Welcome to my personal website and blog! I'm excited to finally have a place to share my thoughts, projects, and learnings.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Software Development**: Tips, tricks, and lessons learned from building applications
- **Tech Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on technologies I'm exploring
- **Project Updates**: Progress on personal and open-source projects
- **Career Insights**: Reflections on working in tech

## Why This Site Exists

I built this site using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a fantastic static site generator. It's fast, flexible, and perfect for a simple blog and portfolio site.

## Stay Tuned

I'm looking forward to sharing more content soon. Thanks for visiting!
